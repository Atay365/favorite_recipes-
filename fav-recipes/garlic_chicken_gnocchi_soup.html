            <li>5 Cups organic chicken stock/broth</li>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium-sized dutch oven pot over medium high-heat, add the butter. Once heated and the butter has melted, add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes. Add the flour, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, oregano, parsley, and basil, stirring until combined.
            </li>
            <li>Add in the chicken stock, stirring frequently to avoid lumping until thickened. Add in the heavy cream, chopped kale, thyme sprigs, shredded chicken, and gnocchi, stirring to combine. Let everything simmer for about 10-12 minutes or until the gnocchi is fully cooked through, floats to the top, and tender.</li>
            <li>Add in the grated parmesan, stirring until cheese has melted and the soup becomes creamy. Simmer for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat, discard thyme leaves, and serve immediately into prepared bowl(s), top with a side of bread or salad, if desired.</li>
