        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In large skillet or wok over medium-high heat, warm 1 ½ teaspoons sesame oil and 1 tablespoon (3 teaspoons) neutral oil. Once oils are hot, add chicken pieces. Let chicken cook for 1 minute without stirring.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon butter, 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, salt, and pepper to skillet. Cook until chicken is no longer pink, approximately 1 to 3 minutes. Stir no more than once or twice so that chicken will brown nicely.</li>
            <li>Transfer cooked chicken to medium bowl and set aside. Wipe out skillet (or wok) to use again.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 teaspoon neutral oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Add diced onion and frozen vegetables. Sauté until onions are almost translucent, approximately 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Move vegetables to one side of skillet. Crack eggs into skillet and scramble with spatula until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Add 4 cups cooked rice and 3 tablespoons butter to skillet. Stir frequently and cook 5 minutes, then stir in 3 tablespoons soy sauce and cook 1 additional minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken, salt, and pepper. Cook until everything is well combined and warmed through, then portion into bowls, garnish with sesame seeds if desired, and serve warm.</li>
