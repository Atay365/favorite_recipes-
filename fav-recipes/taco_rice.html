        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Taco rice is a quick and easy skillet dinner, and I love when my wife makes in on weeknights. Its usually ready in around 30 minutes and for those who love toppings
            there is never a shortage of ideas for this recipe. This isn't to be confused with Mexican Rice, but is actually a recipe that was created in Japan that we have added our own spin to.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup diced yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (1-ounce) package taco seasoning</li>
            <li>1 cup long grain white rice, uncooked</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups salsa</li>
            <li>1 cup grated cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>Optional toppings: diced tomatoes, avocado, sour cream, green onion, tortilla strips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet (*see note) over medium heat. Add in the diced onion and cook until softened.</li>
            <li>Add in the ground beef and continue cooking until browned. Add in the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.</li>
            <li>Stir in the taco seasoning, rice, broth, and salsa. Bring the mixture up to a boil and then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook for 15 - 20 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, stirring occasionally so rice doesn’t stick.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle in the cheese and cilantro and stir to combine. Remove the skillet from the heat, cover and let sit for 2 minutes for the cheese to melt. Season with salt and pepper if desired.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately with desired toppings.</li>
        </ol>
